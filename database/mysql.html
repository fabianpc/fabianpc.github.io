        NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
        SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!
  
        In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
        password for the root user. If you've just installed MariaDB, and
        haven't set the root password yet, you should just press enter here.
        
        Enter current password for root (enter for none): 
        OK, successfully used password, moving on...
        
        Setting the root password or using the unix_socket ensures that nobody
        can log into the MariaDB root user without the proper authorisation.
        
        You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'.
        
        Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] Y
        Enabled successfully!
        Reloading privilege tables..
        ... Success!
        
        
        You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'.
        
        Change the root password? [Y/n] n
        ... skipping.
        
        By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
        to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for
        them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
        go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
        production environment.
        
        Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
        ... Success!
        
        Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
        ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.
        
        Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] 
        ... Success!
        
        By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
        access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
        before moving into a production environment.
        
        Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] 
        - Dropping test database...
        ... Success!
        - Removing privileges on test database...
        ... Success!
        
        Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
        will take effect immediately.
        
        Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] 
        ... Success!
        
        Cleaning up...
        
        All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
        installation should now be secure.
        
        Thanks for using MariaDB!
